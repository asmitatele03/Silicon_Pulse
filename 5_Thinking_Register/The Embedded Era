## 💡 Why I Chose Embedded Systems

Embedded systems is not just coding.
It is about controlling reality.

When we write:

```c
GPIO_PORT |= (1 << 21);
```

We are not just setting a bit.
We are commanding hardware.
We are controlling electricity.
We are turning logic into action.

## 🔍 Embedded Is Different

In high-level programming:

* You think in objects.
* You think in data structures.

In embedded:

* You think in registers.
* You think in memory maps.
* You think in timing.
* You think in constraints.

And that is what builds real engineers.

## ⚡ What Embedded Taught Me

* Precision matters.
* Small mistakes create real-world failures.
* Timing is everything.
* Discipline is non-negotiable.
* Hardware doesn’t forgive assumptions.

---

## 🧠 My Philosophy

I don’t just want to write code.
I want to understand systems.
I want to know how memory is mapped.
How interrupts work.
How Linux talks to hardware.
How drivers translate commands into signals.

Because real engineering happens close to the metal.

---

## 🔥 My Goal

To become an engineer who:

* Understands the kernel.
* Writes efficient C.
* Builds reliable drivers.
* Designs systems that don’t fail.

Not just a programmer.

An engineer.
